    <p>I am a soon to be graduate at SUNY University at Albany. Graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree in
    Computer Science, with a Mathematics Minor. Before my time at SUNY Albany, I was enrolled at Hudson Valley
    Community College, getting my Associate of Science degree in Computer Information Science.
    <br><br>
    Currently, I am in search of a Software Engineer or Software Developer opportunity. Just because I have a lack of
    experience, doesn't mean I have a lack of knowledge. I am experience in Java, C, PHP, Javascript, SQL, and
    HTML & CSS.
    <br><br>
    I have worked with some different frameworks during my educational adventure. Some of the frameworks I am most
    familiar with are Symfony, Boostrap, jQuery, and React.
    <br><br>

        contact with me, just go under <i>CONTACT</i> and send me a message through my email, and I will try my best
        to get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
